# Ensemble-of-Pretrained-Models
We propose a flexible and modular method to combine SOA models into an ensemble to achieve boosted general and long-tail performance at a computational cost.

This repository is the official source code of the paper <a href="TODO arxiv link">Ensemble of Pre-Trained Models for Long-Tailed Trajectory Prediction</a>

Code coming soon ...
